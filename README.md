## DESCRIPTION

Task 3 of the internship focuses on developing a simple AI-based chatbot using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The main objective of this task is to understand how human language can be processed by a computer system and how a chatbot can interact with users through text-based conversations.

In this task, the chatbot was implemented using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, which is a widely used Python library for NLP applications. The chatbot follows a rule-based approach, where predefined patterns are matched with user inputs, and appropriate responses are generated based on those patterns. This approach helps in understanding the basics of conversational AI without involving complex machine learning models.

The chatbot is designed to handle common user queries such as greetings, questions about Python, basic conversational responses, and exit commands. When the user types a message, the chatbot analyzes the input text and compares it with predefined patterns using regular expressions. If a matching pattern is found, the chatbot responds with a suitable reply. This demonstrates the concept of pattern matching, which is an important part of basic NLP systems.

The chatbot interacts with the user in real time through the command-line interface. It continuously accepts user input until an exit command such as “bye” is given. This makes the chatbot interactive and user-friendly. The responses are generated instantly, simulating a simple conversation between a user and an AI system.

Through this task, important concepts such as text processing, natural language understanding, and chatbot logic were learned. The task also provided hands-on experience with the NLTK library and helped in understanding how AI-powered conversational systems work at a fundamental level. Although the chatbot is simple, it effectively demonstrates the core principles of NLP and AI-based interaction.

Overall, Task 3 helped in building a foundational understanding of chatbot development and Natural Language Processing. It shows how Python can be used to create interactive AI applications and serves as a stepping stone toward more advanced NLP and AI projects in the future.
